% Summary:
%   Given an extended state, computes the value of the basis functions,
%   according to the definition of the basis function specified through
%   mons. 
%
% Inputs:
%   mons: array representing a set of monomials. Each row
%       represents one monomial, with each coefficient being the exponent
%       of the associated element of the extended state. E.g.: If the
%       extended state is [x,y,z], a row [1,0,2] represents x*z^2.
%   extendedState: Value of the extended state
%
% Outputs:
%   basisFunctions: Value of the basis functions
